                laboratory testing on patient samples generally shipped via air carriers as well as local couriers from
                the
                unaffiliated
                offices of its health care practitioner customers. Precision Diagnostics therefore has very limited

                interaction
                with patients for whom it performs its laboratory testing services. However, for patients and clients

                Precision
                Diagnostics
                laboratory testing services and the benefits thereof, or otherwise to access or communicate with
                Precision
                Diagnostics,
                Precision Diagnostics also strives to make such communications accessible to and usable by disabled
                persons,
                including
                persons with impaired hearing and vision, through assistive and communication aids provided without

                charge (as described in Sections C and D). In addition, Precision Diagnostics has implemented access
                features
                at
                its San Diego clinical reference laboratory facility, as set forth below. Precision Diagnostics also
                has
                posted
                an Access Notice (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A) on its website, and at its main laboratory
                facility.
              </p>

              </ul>
              <h5> C. Procedures for Communicating Information to Persons with Sensory Impairments:</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>Generally: Precision Diagnostics will take such steps as are necessary to ensure that qualified

                  benefits or
                  services
                  or written material concerning waivers of rights or consent to treatment. All aids needed to provide
                  this
                  notice
                  are provided without cost to the person being served.</li>

                  and who use sign- language as their primary means of communication, the following procedure has been
                  developed
                  and resources identified for obtaining the services of a qualified sign-language interpreter to

                  <li> Precision Diagnostics will utilize a local Sign Language Interpreting Service </li>

                    which transmits
                    texts live, via a telephone line, to a compatible device. Precision Diagnostics provides TTY
                    services if
                    necessary

                  reading
                  them out loud to visually impaired persons. Alternatively, Precision Diagnostics staff will also,
                  upon
                  request
                  and where possible, enlarge printed materials for visually impaired persons.</li>
                <br>
                <li> For Persons With Speech Impairments: TTY support and computers are available to facilitate
                  communication
                  concerning

                participate in,
                or
                benefit from the services offered. The procedures outlined below will reasonably ensure that

                LEP
                persons
                in a language which they understand. Also, they will provide for an effective exchange of information

                practitioner
                that ordered

                lab
                results
                so he/she can interpret and properly diagnosis and treat your medical condition.</p>

                your
                health
                plan about specific lab testing that your treating healthcare practitioner has ordered for you to
                obtain
